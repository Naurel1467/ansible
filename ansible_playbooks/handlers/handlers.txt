 Handlers are modules that are executed if some other module is executed
succesfully and it has made some changes.

Handlers are only executed after all the modules in the tasks section are executed

Handlers are executed in the order that they are mentioned in the handlers section and not in the order that they are called in the tasks section

Even if a handler is called multiple times in the tasks section it will
be executed only once
